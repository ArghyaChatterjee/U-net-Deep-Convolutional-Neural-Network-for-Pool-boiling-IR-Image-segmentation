# U-net-Deep-Convolutional-Neural-Network-for-Pool-boiling-IR-Image-segmentation
● We evaluated qualitative as well as quantitative performance of different image processing and CNN based automatic methods with manually segmented results on Pool Boiling Infra-Red images by measuring important boiling heat transfer parameters statistically for each scheme.<br >
● The time-lapsed high speed pool boiling IR image dataset used in this study unfortunately is not open source and one needs special permission to use this dataset as the dataset is produced inside expensive experimental setup of MIT’s Nuclear Reactor Laboratory.<br >
● One who has access to the dataset can use the code to reproduce the result published in my undergrad thesis. My undergrad Thesis link: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333371480 <br >
● This work is dedicated to ‘Arshiya Smyrna’, daughter of Dr. M.I. Abir, who was born just a month ago. Dr. Abir who is a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering in Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), provided constant support and guidance during this work for which I am grateful to him. Dedicating this work to his daughter is just a small token of gratitude from my side nothing else. <br >
● I am also thankful to the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for letting me use some of the IR images from their Expensive Setup inside Nuclear Reactor Laboratory in order to complete my thesis. <br >
● Special thanks to my respectable supervisor Dr. Maglub Al Nur, Professor of Mechanical Engineering Department at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), for providing me the opportunity to work on this topic and keeping faith in me that I can complete such a delicate task within this one year time period. His continuous support, motivation, friendly behaviour and pragmatic idea backed by helpful mentality really made this work as it is till now.
