# U-net-Deep-Convolutional-Neural-Network-for-Pool-boiling-IR-Image-segmentation
We evaluated qualitative as well as quantitative performance of different image processing and CNN based automatic methods with manually segmented results on Pool Boiling Infra-Red images by measuring important boiling heat transfer parameters statistically for each scheme.
