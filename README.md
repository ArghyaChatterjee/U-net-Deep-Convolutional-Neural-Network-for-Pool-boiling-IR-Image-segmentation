- We evaluated qualitative as well as quantitative performance of different image processing and CNN based automatic methods with manually segmented results on Pool Boiling Infra-Red images by measuring important boiling heat transfer parameters statistically for each scheme.
- The time-lapsed high speed pool boiling IR image dataset used in this study unfortunately is not open source and one needs special permission to use this dataset as the dataset is produced inside expensive experimental setup of MITâ€™s Nuclear Reactor Laboratory.
- One who has access to the dataset can use the code to reproduce the result published in my undergrad thesis. My undergrad Thesis link: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333371480
- Dr. Abir who is a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering in Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a co-supervisor of this work, provided constant support, guidance and resources during this work for which I am grateful to him. 
- I am also thankful to Dr. M. Bucci, Professor of the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) & the lab for letting me use some of the IR images from their Expensive Setup inside Nuclear Reactor Laboratory in order to complete my thesis.
- Here is a short demonstration of my work. For better quality, see the demo on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Px55bKnRF9A). <br>

- Special thanks to my respectable supervisor Dr. Maglub Al Nur, Professor of Mechanical Engineering Department at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), for providing me the opportunity to work on this topic and keeping faith in me that I can complete such a delicate task within this one year time period. His continuous support, motivation, friendly behaviour and pragmatic idea backed by helpful mentality really made this work as it is till now.
- Special thanks to Dr. Matteo Bucci, Professor of Nuclear Science and Engineering Department at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He allowed me to use some of his lab data for which I am grateful to him.
- Special thanks to MIPAR community for their support. They extended their trial version for me on my request. Their software was pretty helpful in all the image processing and post data processing operations inside my thesis.
