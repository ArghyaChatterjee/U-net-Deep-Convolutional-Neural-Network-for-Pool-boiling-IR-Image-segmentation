# U-net-Deep-Convolutional-Neural-Network-for-Pool-boiling-IR-Image-segmentation
● We evaluated qualitative as well as quantitative performance of different image processing and CNN based automatic methods with manually segmented results on Pool Boiling Infra-Red images by measuring important boiling heat transfer parameters statistically for each scheme.<br >
● The time-lapsed high speed pool boiling IR image dataset used in this study unfortunately is not open source and one needs special permission to use this dataset as the dataset is produced inside expensive experimental setup of MIT’s Nuclear Reactor Laboratory.<br >
● One who has access to the dataset can use the code to reproduce the result published in my undergrad thesis. My undergrad Thesis link: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333371480
